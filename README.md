# BIOL174_FinalProject

Final Project for BIOL174 - Data Analysis and Programming for the Life Sciences.

This repository contains a python file that uses Streamlit to display a dashboard for modeling the Predator-Prey model (Lotka-Volterra). It has adjustable sliders for each parameter to show fluctuating prey and predator population levels based on different parameter inputs.
